## VZ Launchpad

This project was part of Verizon internal hackathon (jul 2-4, 2018) on Emerging frontend technologies using React, Graphql, Apollo, Redux etc [Reactathon 2018]
developed by Team-Fugitive (1 member).

VZLaunchPad is an online portal envisioned for the given challenge. This prototype allows candidates seeking job openings in Verizon to interact with recruiters to search and apply for jobs, manging profile, scheduling interviews, get and send feedback, manage communication till end of process. It will also allow the recruiters to search for candidates with past interviews who may be a right fit for the upcoming/current openings.

## Technologies Used

* GRAND stack - Graphql, ReactJs, Apollo, Neo4J Database.
* NodeJs, Express, Apollo for middleware.
* OAuth with Google, LinkedIn was planned for candidate authentication but JWT (Json Web Token) was used along with MongoDB for candidate authentication(prototype). SSO (corporate login) will be integrated for authenticating Verizon employees & recruiters.
* Neo4J for managing relational data and visualizing connections. However, due to connectivity and free plan tier expiring within a week (Neo4J Sandbox), it won't be available for demo (as dates are in future).
* D3.js was planned for visualizing popularity of openings among candidates based on projects, skills, locations.
